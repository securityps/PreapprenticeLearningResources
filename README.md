# Learning Tracks
## Software Development Track
There are many web development languages, frameworks, platforms, and libraries. ASP.NET Core and Node.js are just two; however we have found them quite popular at Kansas City Area companies. The following tutorials are a great starting point for beginning your software development journey.

### C#, ASP.NET Core
*Note: I will gradually replace the .NET Core 3 content with .NET 5 as I identify good tutorials.*

These tutorials focus on a foundational understanding of C#, ASP.NET Core, MVC, WebApi, Entity Framework, and ASP.NET Identity.

### Related Skills
Consider learning to use Git and GitHub early on in the programming track so you can place your code in your own personal repository. You can then show it off to future employers.

## Linux Track
Learn Linux by installing it in a virtual machine such as Virtual Box or Hyper-V, and then try to use it. These tutorials can help, but using it is the best way to learn Linux. If you are unsure which distribution to choose, start with either Ubuntu or Kali Linux.
